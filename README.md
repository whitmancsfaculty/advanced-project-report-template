# Whitman CS Advanced Project Report Template

This repository provides a LaTeX template for advanced project reports (CS 497/8) to be submitted to Penrose Library.

LaTeX is a typesetting language used in some STEM fields including CS, math, and physics.
Documentation is widely available. 
Here is one [online tutorial](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/). 
Most problems are amenable to Googling.

The source code in [`main.tex`](main.tex) is self-documenting.

To use this template, clone the repository and open files using tools suitable to your platform.
* On departmental Linux workstations, use your favorite text editor, `bibtex`, and `pdflatex`.
* On [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), upload a new project, using the zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/whitmancsfaculty/advanced-project-report-template/releases) of this template.
